<p>Project files inspector is a simple cli tool to see how much space every file in the project is allocating. </p>

## Installation

<p>Download the latest binary from the releases section and extract it to a destination you like (The results will be written in the same directory you place the binary file.)</p>

## Usage

- Make sure you are in the same directory with the file you have downloaded.
- Run "pfi -path (the path you want to inspect)". If you want to inspect the current directory, run "pfi -path ."
- The results.txt file will be created in the current working directory.
